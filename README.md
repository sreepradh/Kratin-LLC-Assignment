# CheckList App

Generally, when people grow older their memory often tends to decline and it can be difficult to remember all the tasks they need to complete. A Checklist or Todo list can serve as a memory aid and help elderly people remember what they need to do.

A Checklist or todo list increases productivity by prioritising their tasks and focus on what needs to be done first. It also provides Structure and routine for elderly people, increases time management and also reduces stress that can come with unsure of what to do next.

Overall, a Checklist can be a simple yet powerful tool for elderly people to hep them stay organised, productive and reduce stress


## Features

- Adding a Todo
- Deleting a Todo
- Displaying the tasks left
- Deleting all Todo

Adding a todo is one of the feature that i have implemented like methoined the todo item & click on the Add button and it gets added and another feature is deleting a todo. I have understood that earlier when i refreshthe todo items are getting lost, so i taught of persting so i have stored the list in the local storage as they remain persisted. Lastly i have also implemented delete all feature which deletes all the todo items and also display the todo feature which shows no of tasks left.

## Future Goals

This project can be further extended by adding additional features like searching a particular todo from our todo list,categorising the todo's based on completed, pending etc. Finally, we can also add Remainders and alerts where notifications will be sent upon particular time.
